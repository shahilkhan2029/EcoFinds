Project Document: "EcoFinds - Sustainable Second-Hand 
Marketplace" 
The Challenge: "EcoFinds – Empowering Sustainable Consumption through a 
Second-Hand Marketplace" 
Overall Vision: The overarching vision for EcoFinds is to create a vibrant and trusted 
platform that revolutionizes the way people buy and sell pre-owned goods. It aims to 
foster a culture of sustainability by extending the lifecycle of products, reducing waste, 
and providing an accessible and convenient alternative to purchasing new items. 
EcoFinds envisions becoming the go-to destination for a conscious community seeking 
unique finds and responsible consumption. 
Mission: The mission for the hackathon team is to develop a user-friendly and 
engaging desktop and mobile application that serves as a central hub for buying and 
selling second-hand items. EcoFinds should leverage intuitive design and essential 
features to connect buyers and sellers efficiently, promoting a circular economy and 
making sustainable choices easier for everyone. This involves building a platform that is 
both functional and inspires trust and community. 
Problem Statement  
Develop a foundational version of EcoFinds, focusing on core user authentication and 
product listing functionalities. Teams must deliver a functional prototype, accessible via 
both mobile and desktop interfaces, that allows users to register and log in, create and 
manage basic product listings (including title, description, category, price, and at least 
one image placeholder), and browse these listings with basic filtering and search 
capabilities. The system must employ efficient data structures for managing user and 
product data, ensuring a stable and responsive user experience. 
Features: Application developed in Round 1 should include the following essential 
features, ensuring parity in core functionality across both desktop and mobile platforms: 
● User Authentication: A simple and secure mechanism for user registration and 
login (e.g., email and password). 
● Profile Creation (Basic): Ability for users to set a username. 
● User Dashboard: Should be able to edit all the fields. 
● Product Listing Creation: Functionality for users to create new product listings, 
including attributes such as a title, a brief description, selection of a predefined 
category, a price, and a placeholder for at least one image. 
● Product Listing Management (CRUD - Basic): Ability for users to view, edit, 
and delete their own product listings. 
● Product Browsing: A view displaying a list of available product listings with 
basic information (title, price, and placeholder image). 
● Category Filtering: Ability to filter product listings by predefined categories. 
● Keyword Search: Basic search functionality allowing users to search listings 
based on keywords in the title. 
● Product Detail View: A screen/page displaying the full details of a selected 
product, including title, description, price, category, and the image placeholder. 
● Previous purchase View: A screen/page displaying the products that were 
purchased before. 
● Cart: A screen displaying all the products that are added to the cart.
